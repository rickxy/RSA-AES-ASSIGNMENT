SENDER

Get file/document to encrypt/send
Create randomn AES symmetric key
Get recipients public RSA key
Encrypt AES key with public key (RSA asymmetric)
Use AES key to encrypt file/document(AES symmetric)
Write both encryption AES key and ecrypted file to one bundled file
Send bundled file to recipient, which is very secure


RECIPIENT

Read first 16 bytes of bundled file (get RSA encrypted AES key)
Read next 16 bytes and get IV
Decrypt  AES key with private RSA key
Use AES key to decrypt rest of bundled file
Open file.
